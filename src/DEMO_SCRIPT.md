## 🎯 Handling Common Questions

### "How accurate is the AI?"

**You say**:
> "Great question. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4, the same model that scores in the 90th percentile on professional exams. We've tested it on hundreds of resumes, and it's 90%+ accurate. Plus, you still review every candidate—the AI just helps you prioritize. Think of it like a really smart assistant doing the first pass."

**Demo**: Show 2-3 different candidates with varying scores and point out accuracy.

---

### "What about our specific industry/requirements?"

**You say**:
> "The AI adapts to your job descriptions. It's not generic—it understands context. For a software engineer, it looks for technical skills. For a sales role, it looks for achievement metrics and communication. And we can customize the screening criteria to match exactly what you're looking for."

**Demo**: Show candidates for different roles if you have them.

---

### "Is our data secure?"

**You say**:
> "Absolutely. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use Supabase, an enterprise-grade platform trusted by thousands of companies. Resumes are stored in secure object storage with access controls. We're SOC 2 compliant [if true], and we never share or sell candidate data."

**Show**: Security badge or compliance info if available.

---

### "Can it integrate with our current ATS?"

**You say**:
> "Yes, we have API endpoints that can integrate with most major ATS systems like Greenhouse, Lever, and Workable. We can also export to CSV if you need. But honestly, a lot of our clients end up using this as their primary ATS because it's simpler and more powerful."

---

### "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**You say**:
> "You're always in control. The AI provides recommendations—you make the final decision. If you notice a pattern of mistakes, we can adjust the screening criteria. But think about it: humans make mistakes too, especially when we're tired or screening resume #47 of the day. The AI is consistent and doesn't have unconscious bias."

---

### "How much does it cost?"

**You say**:
> "For unlimited candidates, full AI screening, HR dashboard, and support, it's $59 per month. No per-candidate fees, no hidden costs. Just $59/month. 
>
> Here's the math: If you're currently spending 15 minutes per resume and you get 40 applicants per month, that's 10 hours. If your time is worth $50/hour, that's $500 in time saved. Every month. For a $59 investment.
>
> Plus, we offer a 2-week free trial so you can see the results before committing."

---

### "Can we customize it?"

**You say**:
> "Yes! We can white-label it with your branding, customize the screening criteria, adjust the email templates, add custom fields to the application form, integrate with your calendar for interview scheduling—whatever you need. The starter plan gets you the platform as-is, and we offer custom development for specific requirements."

---

## 💡 Advanced Demo Techniques

### The "Wow" Moment

**After showing AI screening**, say:
> "Now imagine you get 100 applications. Normally, that's 25 hours of work. With HRFlow AI? 20 minutes to review the top-scored candidates. That's the power of automation."

### The Comparison

**Pull out your phone**, say:
> "Let me show you the mobile experience real quick..."

**Show**: Mobile-responsive dashboard

> "Your team can review candidates from anywhere. Coffee shop. Home. Between meetings. It just works."

### The Social Proof

**If you have testimonials**, say:
> "We've onboarded 15 companies in the last 2 months. Here's what [Company Name] said: [testimonial]. They're now processing 3x more candidates in half the time."

---

## 🚀 Closing Techniques

### Technique 1: Trial Close

**You say**:
> "So based on what you've seen, do you think this could save your team time?"

**If yes**:
> "Great! Let's get you set up on the free trial right now. Do you have 5 minutes?"

### Technique 2: Assumptive Close

**You say**:
> "Let's get you started. I'll create your admin account right now, and you can start testing it with your next job opening. What's the best email for your account?"

### Technique 3: Alternative Close

**You say**:
> "Do you want to start with the 2-week free trial, or would you prefer to go straight to the monthly plan to get priority support?"
